# Tiny Snake-O-Tron  

A very simple snake clone written in Lua with LÖVE2D.  
Nothing special about it, I just wanted to finish a game...any game.  
So there it is.  

## Prerequisites

- Latest version of LÖVE2D (www.love2d.org)

## System requirements

_not tested_

- Dual Core x86 CPU > 1 GHz
- a gaphics card capapable of rendering offscreen targets
- 256 MB RAM should be sufficient

## Run the game

### On Mac

Open a terminal and change into the game's directory.  
Type `/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love .`

### On Linux

Same as on Mac but the command may look like `love .` when installed properly.  

__Make sure you have the latest version of LÖVE2D. Some package managers may include older versions which will not work__

### On Windows

Copy love.exe into the game's directory and start it there.

## How to play

You control the snake with the arrow keys.
Hitting 'P' will pause the game.
After you died you can replay the game after hitting escape.  

Eat dots, grow longer and don't rush into your enemy or yourself.
